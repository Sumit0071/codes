File Handling concepts:

1) Read,Write,Append : Various modes

By default mode is read [r] 

Different file handling operations:

1)f=open(fname,mode,buffer)
2)f.name = displays file name
3)f.mode = displays the mode of the file
4)f.closed = checks whether the file is closed or not 
5)f.close = closes the file manually 
6)with open('file.txt') as f:  = this option automatically closes the file after use 

FOR READ : 

1)f.read(size) = reads the file , size signifies the first n characters from the file and reads it
2)f.readline(size) = read only the first line
3)f.readlines(size) = read all the lines from the file and it makes a list of all those with '\n' terminator at last

FOR WRITE:

1)f.write(fw) = writes in the file also it over-write the previous content if present 
2)f.writelines(fw) = write in the file generally used for writing in different lines. 

[Refer write.py for better understanding]

FOR APPEND:

Same as write just open it in append mode (a)

FILE PATH:

1) For Absolute Path:
Write r before the absolute path to make it as the raw string otherwise it will not be able to understand that as the path

2) For Relative Path:
Just write the file name and make sure that they are in the same working directory
