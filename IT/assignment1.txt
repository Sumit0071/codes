Introduction to Python Programming

1. Write a program to convert temperature from degree Celsius to degree Fahrenheit

2. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

3. Write a program to swap the value of two variables using a third variable and without using a third variable.
           
4. Write a program to swap two numbers using bitwise operators.
           a=a^b
           b=a^b
           a=a^b 

5. Write a program to rotate the value of x, y, and z such that x has the value of y, y has the value of z and z has the value of x.
           Basically nothing but swaping using 4 variables

6. Write a program to display the following numbers: 5678, 678, 78, 8, where the given number is 5678.
           Using basic arithmetical operations and nothing else 

7. Write a program to add two complex numbers by reading the numbers from the user.
           Use complex data type i.e. a+jb

8. Write a program to accept the principal amount, rate of interest, and duration from the user. Calculate the interest amount and the total amount (principal + interest).
           I= (P*T*R)/100
